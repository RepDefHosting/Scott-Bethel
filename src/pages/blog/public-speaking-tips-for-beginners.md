A speaking engagement is a private or public event that hosts a speaker. Speakers inspire or inform audiences on a topic they are either passionate or knowledgeable about. Some people also make a career as professional speakers. But how can you succeed and win paid speaking engagements?

You must deliver engaging content to succeed and build a reputation as a public speaker. People and event organizers are more likely to seek you out for their functions when they realize you deliver helpful and unique content or bring new perspectives to a topic or issue.

A critical step is to identify your audience. Are you targeting business people, political leaders, students, or other professionals? What do you want to talk about?
