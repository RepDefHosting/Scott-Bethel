The National Security Advisor sees a requirement to stockpile weapons and ammunition for the years ahead. Jake Sullivan has expressed the belief that the US and Western Defense Industry continues to underestimate the quantity and cost of stockpiling weapons systems and ammunition needed to deter such peer countries as Russia and China in the coming years. Sullivan said that the demand signal tends to meet a just in time need however with his encouragement president Biden has pumped more than $50 billion into the US industrial base and begun to make linkages and connections with partner nations prepared to assist as the US developed a better capability. One of the biggest indicators is the rapid depletion of stockpiles as a result of the Ukraine and Israeli wars. BC analysts believe that there will be a market that will grow for increasing production capacity, ammo, upgrades, and battle damage repairs for a wide range of existing weapons systems. Such attrition, will take away resources from new development and new system acquisition.
